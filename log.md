# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I decided to try out a new code challenge site called HackerRank because I sort of committed to this #100DaysOfCode challenge at the last minute. You can read more about that in my blog post (COMING SOON!).

**Thoughts:** It was very basic Ruby code so I had to clean off the cobwebs in my brain kind of similar to what you did every school year after summer vacation ended. The only hang-up I had was that I had forgotten to increment the index number at the end of each iteration of the while loop but I caught on to that pretty quickly and it was smooth sailing from there!

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of Flatiron's Sinatra section curriculum: Intro to Capybara Tests, Dynamic Routes, and Dynamic Routes Lab.

**Thoughts**: I really like how the dynamic routes work! It's so intuitive and user-friendly-it just makes sense to me. I'm sooo looking forward to the Sinatra project coming up and working with this concept. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/meg_gutshall/status/1080654606613573633)
