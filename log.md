# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I decided to try out a new code challenge site called HackerRank because I sort of committed to this #100DaysOfCode challenge at the last minute. You can read more about that in my blog post (COMING SOON!).

**Thoughts:** It was very basic Ruby code so I had to clean off the cobwebs in my brain kind of similar to what you did every school year after summer vacation ended. The only hang-up I had was that I had forgotten to increment the index number at the end of each iteration of the while loop but I caught on to that pretty quickly and it was smooth sailing from there!

### Day 2: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of Flatiron's Sinatra section curriculum: Intro to Capybara Tests, Dynamic Routes, and Dynamic Routes Lab.

**Thoughts**: I really like how the dynamic routes work! It's so intuitive and user-friendly-it just makes sense to me. I'm sooo looking forward to the Sinatra project coming up and working with this concept.

### Day 3: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of Flatiron's Sinatra section curriculum: HTML Forms and Params.

**Thoughts**: Not gonna lie, I was doing this at a bar so I will probably have to review this again soon... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Day 4: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some of Flatiron's Sinatra section curriculum: Passing Data Between Views and Controllers and Basic Sinatra Forms Lab.

**Thoughts**: First off, LOVED the examples they used for this lab. Some of the greats... not basketball, but there's a team called the Utah Jazz, right? I found it fascinating how you can retrieve user input, manipulate it, and return it in another path on your site. I was confused though with the get and post methods and which paths they were supposed to use. (Again, why I need to review the HTML Forms and Params lesson.) If it still doesn't make sense after I review, I plan on using Flatiron's 'Ask A Question' feature to try to understand.
